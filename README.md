# Devember 2020 (web-app utilizing Rust)
This is the repository for my devember 2020 challenge, where I'll hopefully 
create some cool web-app with rust.

## Day 1

Today I came up with a battle plan on how to procede, give that I've never really
used any Rust or done any web development.
The Idea is to first focus on getting a website up and running, for this I have
two starting points 
1. [Rust wasm tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/)
2. [Yew framework examples](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/tree/master/examples)

Today I've started on the first item and got a web page up and went a little
deeper into the tutorial

Next up I want to further familiarize with the technologies I want to use 
(The whole HTML/CSS/JS and Rust stack and how it interacts with the browser
and such). After that I'll look into how to get started on actually coding
what my app should do, which is a programmatic approach to ECAD (think of it 
as a combination of [openscad](http://www.openscad.org/) and [kicad](https://kicad.org/)
with the goal being to eventually be able to create a small circuit and hopefully
get it fabricated (something like a small 555 blinky thing)
